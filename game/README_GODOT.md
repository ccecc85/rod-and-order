Getting started with the Godot project

1. Open Godot and choose "Import" or "Open" and select this `game` folder.
2. Create your main scene (e.g. `main.tscn`) and set it as the main scene in Project Settings → Application → Run → Main Scene.
3. Configure export presets in Project → Export (add Desktop presets for Windows/Linux/macOS). Save presets so `export_presets.cfg` appears in the project folder.
4. Use the scripts in `tools/` to automate builds once Godot is installed.

Notes:
- This folder contains only a minimal `project.godot`. Add your scenes, scripts, assets, and `export_presets.cfg` through the Godot editor.
